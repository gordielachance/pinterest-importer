Backup all your pins from Pinterest into Wordpress !  Own your data !

== Description ==

Pinterest Importer allows you to connect to your Pinterest.com account; to fetch all your pins (including from secret boards); then to import them into Wordpress.

The difference with other plugins is that it is not based on the (very limited) official Pinterest API.  
This means that you can make a full backup (instead of getting only the last x pins); but it also means the plugin may broke one day or another.
Better use it quick !

* Nice GUI
* Get pins from public boards, secret boards, and likes
* Set import options for each of your boards (which category to use, etc)
* Import original HD images from pins
* Set pin creation date as post date
* Supports both image & video pins; and set corresponding post format
* Handles hashtags,which are converted to post tags
* May be run several times as existing pins will not be imported again
* Save the original Pin informations (pin ID, source, etc) as post metas (with prefix _pinterest-)

= Donate! =
It truly took me a LOT of time to code this plugin.
If it saved you the time to backup manually a few hundred (or more!) pins, please consider converting this time into [a donation](http://bit.ly/gbreant).
This would be very appreciated â€” Thanks !

This plugin requires at least php 5.3.

2. Select "Authentification" tab; and login to Pinterest
