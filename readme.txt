Backup your Pinterest.com account by importing pins as Wordpress posts.  Supports boards, secret boards and likes.

== Description ==

Pinterest Importer allows you to connect to your Pinterest.com account; to grab all your pins (including from secret boards); and to import them as Wordpress posts.

The difference with other plugins is that it is not based on the (very limited) official Pinterest API.  
This means that you can make a full backup (instead of getting only the last x pins); but it also means the plugin may broke one day or another.
Better use it quick !

* Nice GUI
* Get pins from public boards, secret boards, and likes
* Supports both image & video pins; and set corresponding post format
* Import original HD images from pins
* Can be used on an ongoing basis : pins will not be imported several times
* Set pin creation date as post date
* Handles hashtags, which are converted to post tags
* Keep the original pin informations (pin ID, source, etc) attached to the post (stored as post metas)

= Donate! =
It truly took me a LOT of time to code this plugin.
If it saved you the time to backup manually a few hundred (or more!) pins, please consider converting this time into [a donation](http://bit.ly/gbreant).
This would be very appreciated â€” Thanks !
